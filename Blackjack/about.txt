Project: Blackjack 
Art Source: 100 days of python Udemy course

This contains my solution to the challenge to create a blackjack game. 
In addition there is the instructors solution so those viewing can see

This demonstrates my ability to use python random, list, and dictionary methods 
to compare drawn cards using conditional statements(if/elif/else) with boolean logic.
I also use while and for loops to iterate through data and perform operations
while a condition is true
